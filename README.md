### Docker Compose

A Docker Compose template is in [compose.yml](compose.yml).

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Postgres
- This service.
- A commented out frontend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### PostgreSQL

The database is configured to use PostgreSQL and to use Liquibase to manage migrations.

Thew best way to run liquibase locally is to use Homebrew to install
```shell
brew install liquibase
```

Liquibase properties file in the root of the project defines all the properties that can be used to configure the database.


Running liquibase migrations locally:
 

``` bash
 liquibase update 

```

A more extensive setup is available in [github.com/DEFRA/cdp-local-environment](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-local-environment)

### MongoDB

#### MongoDB via Docker

See above.

```
docker compose up -d mongodb
```

#### MongoDB locally

Alternatively install MongoDB locally:

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/#installation) on your local machine
- Start MongoDB:
```bash
sudo mongod --dbpath ~/mongodb-cdp
```

#### MongoDB in CDP environments

In CDP environments a MongoDB instance is already set up
and the credentials exposed as enviromment variables.


### Inspect MongoDB

To inspect the Database and Collections locally:
```bash
mongosh
```

You can use the CDP Terminal to access the environments' MongoDB.

### Testing

Run the tests with:

Tests run by running a full `WebApplication` backed by [Ephemeral MongoDB](https://github.com/asimmon/ephemeral-mongo).
Tests do not use mocking of any sort and read and write from the in-memory database.

```bash
dotnet test
````

### Running

Run CDP-Deployments application:
```bash
dotnet run --project AuthLivestockPoc --launch-profile Development
```

### SonarCloud

Example SonarCloud configuration are available in the GitHub Action workflows.

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`
